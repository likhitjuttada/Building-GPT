Welcome! I experiment with all sorts of Natural Language Processing(NLP) Applications in this repository. The goal is to gain a better appreciation for NLP systems, including recurrent networks, transformers, BERT and Large Language Models (LLMs)
like ChatGPT. Additionally, I aim to understand the technologies built around it, like tokenizers, embeddings, and vector databases to naw a few.
